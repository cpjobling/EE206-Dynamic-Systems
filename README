This project contains LaTeX source files for a set of notes and slides for a 
level 2 module on Dynamic Systems. It covers state-space modelling, sampled data systems
and the z-Tranform. It will form the basis of some notes for a new module on Addvanced Control.

The notes are copyright (C) Swansea University but are made freely available.
