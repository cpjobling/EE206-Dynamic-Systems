At each sampling instant the switch is
closed for an infinitesimal time, during which the digital signal
has the same value as the continuous signal. The digital signal is
therefore a ``\emph{Sequence}'' \[\ldots\ v_{-2}\ v_{-1}\ v_{0}\
v_{1}\ v_{2}\ \ldots \] which will be denoted by
\[\left\{v_k\right\}\]
