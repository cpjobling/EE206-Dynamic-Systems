The index $k$ denotes the current value. Digital signals will be
taken as zero prior to the time origin, in the same way as
continuous signals:
\[ v_k = v(kT) = 0\ \mathrm{for}\ k<0. \]

Except in cases where it is necessary to distinguish between them,
both the continuous signal $v(t)$ and the digital signal
$\left\{v_k\right\}$ will be denoted by $v$.
