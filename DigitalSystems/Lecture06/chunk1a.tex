Only regular sampling will be considered. A constant period $T$~s
between sampling instants is equivalent to a sampling frequency
$\omega_s$~rad~s$^{-1}$, where \[ T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega_s}. \]

Sampling is assumed to be synchronized to the time origin $t=0$ so
that \[ v_k = v(kT)\ \mathrm{for\ all }\ k.\]
